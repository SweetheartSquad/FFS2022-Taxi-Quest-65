## Development

```sh
npm i # installs dependencies
npm start # starts dev server
npm run build # creates production build
```

Hot-reload is available for [`./src/assets/main.strand`](./src/assets/main.strand) which allows you to interactively edit passages, but most other changes will trigger a page refresh.
